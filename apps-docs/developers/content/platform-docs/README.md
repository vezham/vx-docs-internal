# HeroUI documentation

Local adaptations: React → web routes under `/docs-ui`, English content (Chinese routes fall back to English),
portable MDX presentation, and lazy-loaded local component previews with their source code.
Web examples run locally using src/demos/heroui; Next.js-only helpers are adapted to React. Native videos use upstream media.
Guide prose retains upstream package names; executable demos use the Vezham package aliases.
